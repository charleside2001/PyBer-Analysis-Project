# PyBer with Matplotlib Analysis 
## Overview of PyBer Analysis
The objective of this project is to assist V. Isualize and decision-makers at PyBer with  a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type as well as creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results
  * The summary DataFrame shows that;
    * The rural city type experiences a shortage in drivers making the total rides in 2019 very low and average fare per driver the highest as compared with other city types
    * This is followed by suburban city type with a medium average fare per driver due to the total number of rides
    * Urban city types has the lowest fare per driver making the average fare per ride the lowest as compared with the other city types over a four months period in 2019

 * The multiple-line chart shows that;
    * The total fare per city type is highest over a period of four months in 2019
    * the reverse is the case with the rural city type having the lowest total fare 
    * The suburban city type is next to the urban city in terms of hierarchy
    * Peak periods of the month with the highest fares for all city types was seen at the beginning of the last week of February and at the same time, the suburban city type experiences teh highest drop in fare during the last week in february

 ## Summary
Based on this analysis;   
* It is recommended that the CEO allows drivers to drive more frequently during the peak period of the months for all city types.
* It is recommended that the CEO invest more on the urban city type.
* It is recommended that the CEO discourages drivers from driving in the rural city types most especially during the first week of January and second week of February.
